pis2map will extract all labels out of a .PIS file saved from PS2Dis
and store it in a .map file that can be loaded from PS2Dis. The purpose
is to be able to move all of your labels from one dump to another without
having to copy and paste every single one of them. Use this at your own
descretion. I do not take any responsibility for any misuse or potential
file curruption that might (if ever) occur.

Execute from command prompt with 2 arguments, input file and output file.
Example:

pis2map mydump.pis mylabels.map
